<p>The method employed in this edition of the <cite>Monumentum Ancyranum</cite>
is suggested by the purpose for which it is intended. That purpose
is primarily to adapt it as one of the series of <cite>Translations and
Reprints from the Original Sources of European History</cite>, published
by the Department of History of the University of Pennsylvania.
The English version is the core of the work. At the same time the
opportunity has been seized to present the original texts in such form
as to be of real philological service. That there is room for such
an edition of the <cite>Monumentum Ancyranum</cite> there can be no doubt.
The critical edition published by Mommsen in 1883, <cite>Res Gestæ Divi
Augusti</cite>, must long remain for scholars the sufficient hand-book for
the study of the greatest of inscriptions. But that edition, with its
Latin notes, is not adapted for ordinary school or college use, or for
historical study by those who do not readily use Latin. And although
Roman histories constantly refer to this great source for the life and
times of Augustus, there has been no accessible English translation. It
is true that the English translation of Duruy’s <cite>History of Rome</cite>
contains a version of the <cite>Monumentum</cite>, but it is not in full
accord with the latest text as set forth by Mommsen, and is hidden away
in the ponderous volumes of that expensive work.</p>

<p>Aside from Mommsen’s edition of 1883, the only recent edition is a
French one of 1886 by C. Peltier. But this is simply a condensation of
Mommsen. While the present edition depends very largely on Mommsen’s
work, it is more than a condensation. Not only is the English version
given, but all the known studies of the text published since 1883,
and in criticism of Mommsen, have been collated. The emendations thus
suggested have been placed as footnotes to the Latin and Greek texts.
Moreover, the notes have been carefully revised. For the most part they
are much reduced in compass, but in many cases they are added to; and
a large number of typographical errors in Mommsen’s edition have been
corrected. Most of these errors were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span> reproduced in the French edition
above mentioned. In a work with such a multitude of references it is
too much to hope that all errors have been avoided, and the editor will
be greatly indebted if users of the book will report them to him.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">I. History of the Inscription.</span></h3></div>

<p>Suetonius in his <cite>Life of Augustus</cite> tells us that that Emperor had
placed in charge of the Vestal virgins his will and three other sealed
documents; and the four papers were produced and read in the senate
immediately after his death. One of these additional documents gave
directions as to his funeral; another gave a concise account of the
state of the empire; the third contained a list of “his achievements
which he desired should be inscribed on brazen tablets and placed
before his mausoleum.” These tablets perished in the decline of Rome.
Centuries passed; men had ceased to ask about them, and there was no
idea that they would ever be brought to light. Nor were the original
tablets ever found. But in 1555 Buysbecche, a Dutch scholar, was sent
on an embassy from the Emperor Ferdinand II. to the Sultan Soliman
at Amasia in Asia Minor; and a letter of his, published among others
at Frankfort in 1595, tells the story of the discovery of a copy of
this epitaph of Augustus. He writes: “On our nineteenth day from
Constantinople we reached Ancyra. Here we found a most beautiful
inscription, and a copy of those tablets on which Augustus had placed
the story of his achievements.” From this situation of the copy comes
the common title, <cite>Monumentum Ancyranum</cite>. Buysbecche made some
attempt to copy the Latin inscription, but his work was very hasty and
incomplete. What he had discovered was of extreme importance, and his
report stimulated such interest that European scholars never rested
till as complete a copy as possible was finally made in our own time.
The temple on whose walls the inscription was found was one dedicated
to Augustus and Rome, as was a common custom during the lifetime of
that Emperor. It was a hexastyle of white marble, with joints of such
exquisite workmanship that even in this century it was difficult to
trace some of them. This temple had served as a Christian church till
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span> fifteenth century, and from that time has been part of a Turkish
mosque, some sections of its enclosure being used as a cemetery. The
great inscription was cut on the two side walls of the pronaos, or
vestibule. It was in six pages, three on the left as one entered, and
three on the right. Each page contained from forty-two to fifty-four
lines, and each line an average of sixty letters. The pages cover six
courses of the masonry in height, about 2.70 metres, and the length of
the inscription on each wall is about 4 metres. On one of the outer
walls of the temple was a Greek translation of the Latin. This measures
1.38 metres in height by 21 metres in length. Several Turkish houses
had been built against the wall containing this Greek version, and
this made the reading of it, and still more the copying, an extremely
difficult task. The priceless value of the Greek version lies in the
fact that it supplements in many cases the breaks in the Latin. For
it is needless to say that an inscription so old and so exposed has
suffered much from time and violence. Various travelers have described
the temple and its treasure: Tournefort in his <cite>Voyage du Levant</cite>,
Lyons, 1717; Kinneir, <cite>Journey Through Asia Minor</cite>, 1818; Texier,
<cite>Description de l’Asie mineure</cite>, Paris, 1839; William Hamilton,
<cite>Researches in Asia Minor</cite>, London, 1842; and most completely,
Guillaume, Perrot and Delbet, in their <cite>Exploration archéologique de
la Galatie, etc., in 1861</cite>, Paris, 1872.</p>

<p>Numerous attempts were made at transcribing the inscription, and a
number of editions were published. Buysbecche’s fragments found several
editors in the century of their discovery. About a hundred years after
him Daniel Cosson, a merchant from Leyden, who had lived many years at
Smyrna, dying there in 1689, caused an attempt to be made to secure a
copy, and with somewhat better results. His copy was edited at Leyden
in 1695. In 1701 Joseph Pitton de Tournefort, under direction of
Louis XIV, visited Ancyra, and attempted to secure a facsimile of the
text. In 1705 Paul Lucas, also sent by Louis XIV, spent twenty days
in copying the Latin, and his work was the last of its kind till the
present century. While these early copies are far from being as perfect
as more recent ones, they have this value: that in a number of cases
they show parts of the inscription which progressive disintegration has
now rendered illegible.</p>

<p>The Greek text, owing to the buildings reared against it, was much
harder to transcribe. In 1745 Richard Pococke published a few
fragments, and in 1832 Hamilton copied pages 10, 11, 12 and 13 of the
nineteen into which the Greek is divided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<p>Within recent years all has been done that can possibly be done to
secure perfect copies of both Greek and Latin. In 1859 the Royal
Academy of Berlin commissioned a scholar named Mordtmann to secure a
<em>papier maché</em> cast of the Latin, and to transcribe the Greek. He
failed in both attempts, and declared that the casts would ruin the
original.</p>

<p>Napoleon III. commissioned George Perrot and Edmund Guillaume to
explore Asia Minor. In their work above mentioned they give a facsimile
copy of the whole of the Latin, and of as much of the Greek as they
could get at. Their plates were the basis of an edition of the text by
Mommsen in 1865, and another by Bergk in 1873, and of the text given in
the <cite>Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum</cite>.</p>

<p>But Mommsen and the Berlin Academy were not satisfied. Carl Humann had
distinguished himself by his researches at Pergamos, and to him they
committed the task of securing casts of the whole of both texts. The
story of his achievement is extremely interesting. Difficulty after
difficulty was met and surmounted. And finally he succeeded in his
plan. With materials dug near-by he made plaster casts. The owners of
the Turkish houses he succeeded in inducing to allow their walls to be
so far torn away as to permit him to get at the entire Greek text. And
finally twenty great cases containing the whole series of casts were
sent away on pack mules to the coast and thence to Berlin. The Royal
Academy now counts these casts among its chief treasures. This was
in 1882. In 1883 Mommsen published his great critical edition of the
text, on which this edition is based. His work is almost final on the
subject, but especially in the matter of conjectural fillings of the
<em>lacunæ</em> is subject to revision. But an inspection of the text
as given in this volume will show that we have the words of Augustus
almost in their entirety.</p>

<p>At Apollonia, on the borders of Phrygia and Pisidia, has been found
another ruined temple, with remnants of the Greek version of this
inscription. At Apollonia the inscription originally covered seven
pages. Of these there are still legible the upper portions of pages
two, three, four and five. The correspondence between the text at
Ancyra and that at Apollonia is almost exact, and where there is a
divergence, it has been indicated.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">II. Character and Purpose of the Inscription.</span></h3></div>

<p>German scholars have waged a fierce warfare over the question of the
literary character of the <cite>Res Gestæ</cite>, as Mommsen commonly calls
it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span> He himself refrains from assigning it decidedly to any class of
composition. Is it epitaph, or a “statement of account,” or “political
statement”? Otto Hirschfeld contends strongly it is not an epitaph
because it contains no dates of birth or death, and is in the first
person. Wölfflin calls it a statement of account. Geppert sides with
Hirschfeld. Bormann, Schmidt and Nissen all hold it to be an epitaph.
And this appears to be the final agreement. The latest word is the
discussion by Bormann, in 1895, in which he still maintains the epitaph
view. For these discussions, cf. the bibliography at the end of this
volume.</p>

<p>Of course it is an epitaph of unique character. It has certain striking
peculiarities, and specially of omission. There is no mention of
domestic affairs. The wife of the Emperor is unnamed. Although in
enumerating his honors and offices it was necessary to date events by
the names of consuls, yet aside from this he mentions no person outside
the imperial household, not even such favorites as Mæcenas and Agrippa.
His foes, Brutus, Cassius and Antony, are several times alluded to,
but never named. The same is true of Lepidus and Sextus Pompeius.
Unfortunate events are not noticed. His omission of the disaster to
the Roman arms under Varus has been severely criticised as an attempt
to deceive; but if the inscription is really an epitaph one cannot
wonder at such silence. The omission of the dates of birth and death
has been variously explained. Some have thought that he meant his heirs
to fill in any such gaps after his death, and to recast the whole into
the third person. Or, it has been suggested that it was the desire of
Augustus to be counted a divinity, and that therefore he wished to pose
as one “without beginning of years, or end of days.” It certainly would
be incongruous to record the death of a god. With regard to his general
purpose Mommsen says: “No one would look for the arcana of empire in
such a document, but for such things as an <em>imperator</em> of mind
shrewd rather than lofty, and who skillfully bore the character of a
great man while he himself was not great, wished the whole people, and
especially the rabble, to believe about him.” Two purposes are manifest
throughout the document. One is to pose as a saviour of the state from
its foes, and not at all as a seeker after personal aggrandizement;
another is to represent his whole authority as having been exercised
under constitutional forms. These two ideas appear again and again.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">III. Divisions of the Text.</span></h3></div>

<p>The text may be roughly divided into three sections. Chapters one
to fourteen give the various offices held by Augustus, and the
honors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span> bestowed upon him; chapters fifteen to twenty-four recount
his expenditures for the good of the state and the people; and the
remaining chapters, twenty-five to thirty-five, give the statement
of his various achievements in war, and his works of a more peaceful
character. This classification will not hold rigorously, but is true in
the main.</p>

<p>The division into chapters or paragraphs is marked in the Latin text
by making the first line of each chapter project a little to the left
of the remaining lines. Each such paragraph is relatively complete.
And the use of such a topical method marks a new manner of composition
quite different from the old annalistic style of Roman historiography.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">IV. The Greek Version.</span></h3></div>

<p>George Kaibel has made a special study of the Greek version, and is led
to the opinion that it was made by a Roman rather than by a Greek. It
is a grammar and dictionary rendering, rather than the idiomatic work
of one quite at home in the use of Greek. This conclusion is based
upon linguistic grounds. A further question remains as to where this
translation was made, whether at Rome or in the provinces. The fact of
the identity of the two copies at Apollonia and at Ancyra would seem to
indicate a common Roman source.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">V. The Supplement.</span></h3></div>

<p>This is poorly written both in the Latin and in the Greek; and it is
also a very imperfect summary of the document, summing up only what
was spent upon games, donations and buildings. The fact that it is in
the third person also proves that it is not the work of Augustus. The
reckoning by denarii rather than by sesterces points to a Greek origin,
and the mention of favors shown by Augustus to provincial towns (cf. c.
4 and notes) would indicate one outside of Rome.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">VI. Trustworthiness of the Inscription.</span></h3></div>

<p>The corroborations of the inscription by other inscriptions, coins and
later historians, as well as by allusions in contemporary literature,
form an interesting study. And the trustworthiness of the record
becomes more manifest the more one compares its statements with those
of other writers. Only one point has been found where Augustus makes
what might be challenged as a perversion of fact. (Cf. c. 2, note <a href="#Footnote_16">16</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">VII. Masons’ Blunders.</span></h3></div>

<p>A number of apparent errors in the text are to be attributed in all
probability to the stone-cutters at Ancyra. Such are the superfluous

<h3 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">VIII. Signs and Abbreviations.</span></h3></div>

<p>The Latin and Greek texts are printed in such a way as to give the
best idea practicable of their actual condition. Roman numerals denote
the pages of the inscription, and the Arabic figures the lines. These
numerals and the chapter headings are no part of the inscription. The
projection of the first line of each chapter in the Latin is the only
method of marking the divisions in the original.</p>

<p>Parts of the Greek and Latin text included within brackets, [], are
conjectural restorations of the portions of the inscription which have
perished. The Greek generally is a guide to the Latin and <em>vice
versa</em>, for the instances are rare where both versions have been
lost. The textual notes show that not all scholars have reckoned the
same number of missing letters. These variations are quite allowable,
for it is impossible to say that just so many letters are missing in
any given case, owing to the various sizes of different letters, and
varying degrees of closeness of writing.</p>

<p>Where dots (...) occur, it signifies that Mommsen reckons as many
letters unrestored as there are dots.</p>

<p>The sign § indicates a mark in the original resembling a figure 7, or a
very open 3.</p>

<p>The same sign in brackets [§] indicates an unfilled interval in the
stone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

<p>The apices over vowels in the Latin indicate similar marks in the
original in the case of a, e, o and u, and in the case of i a
prolongation of that letter above the line.</p>

<p>Where certain letters of the Latin text are italicized it indicates
that while they do not appear in the plaster casts, yet they were
traced by Alfred Domaszewski (a fellow-worker with Humann) on the stone
itself, by means of certain discolorations from paint, or gilding, or
weather, which marked the bottom of the incisions of the letters in
several cases where the surface of the stone had been worn away.</p>

<p>In the textual notes, B. stands for Bormann, G. for Geppert, S. for J.
Schmidt, Sk. for Seeck, W. for Wölfflin, Apoll. for the inscription at
Apollonia, and Anc. for that at Ancyra.</p>

<p>The abbreviations of the names of authors and their works in the
historical notes are indicated in the bibliography at the close of the
book.</p>

<p>In my twentieth year,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> acting upon my own judgment<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> and at my

a faction.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> On account of this the senate by laudatory decrees
admitted me to its order,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> in the consulship of Gaius Pansa and Aulus
Hirtius, and at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span> the same time gave me consular rank in the expression

I as propraetor,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> together with the consuls, should see to it that
the commonwealth suffered no harm.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> In the same year, moreover, when
both consuls had perished in war, the people made me consul,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> and
triumvir for organizing the commonwealth.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>Those who killed my father<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> I drove into exile by lawful
judgments,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> avenging their crime, and afterwards, when they waged

<p>I undertook civil and foreign wars by land and sea throughout the whole
world, and as victor I showed mercy to all surviving citizens.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>
Foreign peoples, who could be pardoned with safety, I preferred to
preserve rather than to destroy. About five hundred thousand Roman
citizens took the military oath of allegiance to me.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> Of these I
have settled in colonies or sent back to their <em>municipia</em>,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
upon the expiration of their terms of service,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> somewhat over three
hundred thousand, and to all these I have given lands purchased by
me, or money for farms,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> out of my own means. I have captured six
hundred ships, besides those which were smaller than triremes.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>Twice I have triumphed in the ovation,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> and three times in the
curule triumph,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> and I have been twenty-one times saluted as
imperator.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

<p>After that, when the senate decreed me many triumphs,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> I declined
them. Likewise I often deposited the laurels in the Capitol<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> in
fulfilment of vows which I had also made in battle. On account of
enterprises brought to a successful issue on land and sea by me, or
by my lieutenants under my auspices, the senate fifty-five times
decreed that there should be a thanksgiving to the immortal gods.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
The number of days, moreover, on which thanksgiving was rendered
in accordance with the decree of the senate was eight hundred and
ninety.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> In my triumphs there have been led before my chariot nine
kings, or children of kings.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> When I wrote these words I had been
thirteen times consul, and was in the thirty-seventh year of the

<p>The dictatorship which was offered to me by the people and the senate,
both when I was absent and when I was present, in the consulship of
Marcus Marcellus and Lucius Arruntius, I did not accept.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> At a time
of the greatest dearth of grain I did not refuse the charge of the food
supply, which I so administered that in a few days, at my own expense,
I freed the whole people from the anxiety and danger in which they then
were.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> The annual and perpetual consulship offered to me at that
time I did not accept.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 class="nobreak">c. 6.</h3></div>

<p>During the consulship of Marcus Vinucius and Quintus Lucretius, and
afterwards in that of Publius and Cnaeus Lentulus, and a third time in
that of Paullus Fabius Maximus and Quintus Tubero, by the consent of
the senate and the Roman people I was voted the sole charge of the laws
and of morals, with the fullest power;<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> but I accepted the proffer
of no office which was contrary to the customs of the country.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> The
measures of which the senate at that time wished me to take charge, I
accomplished in virtue of my possession of the tribunitial power.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>
In this office I five times associated with myself a colleague, with
the consent of the senate.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>For ten years in succession I was one of the triumvirs for organizing
the commonwealth.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>
Up to that day on which I write these words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
I have been <em>princeps</em> of the senate through forty years.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>

<p>In my fifth consulship, by order of the people and the senate, I
increased the number of the patricians.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> Three times I have revised
the list of the senate.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> In my sixth consulship, with Marcus Agrippa
as colleague, I made a census of the people. I performed the lustration
after forty-one years. In this lustration the number of Roman citizens
was four million and sixty-three thousand.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> Again assuming the
consular power in the consulship of Gaius Censorinus and Gaius Asinius,
I alone performed the lustration. At this census the number of Roman
citizens was four million, two hundred and thirty thousand.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> A third
time, assuming the consular power in the consulship of Sextus Pompeius
and Sextus Appuleius, with Tiberius Cæsar as colleague, I performed the
lustration. At this lustration the number of Roman citizens was four
million, nine hundred and thirty-seven thousand.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> By new legislation
I have restored many customs of our ancestors which had now begun to
fall into disuse, and I have myself also committed to posterity many
examples worthy of imitation.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<p>The senate decreed that every fifth year vows for my good health should
be performed by the consuls and the priests. In accordance with these
vows games have been often celebrated during my lifetime, sometimes
by the four chief colleges, sometimes by the consuls.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> In private,
also, and as municipalities, the whole body of citizens have constantly
sacrificed at every shrine for my good health.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<div class="section">

<p>By a decree of the senate my name has been included in the Salian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>hymn,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> and it has been enacted by law that I should be sacrosanct,
and that as long as I live I should be invested with the tribunitial
power.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> I refused to be made <em>pontifex maximus</em> in the place of
a colleague still living, when the people tendered me that priesthood
which my father held. I accepted that office after several years, when
he was dead who had seized it during a time of civil disturbance;
and at the comitia for my election, during the consulship of Publius
Sulpicius and Gaius Valgius, so great a multitude assembled as, it is
said, had never before been in Rome.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>Close to the temples of Honor and Virtue, near the Capena gate, the
senate consecrated in honor of my return an altar to Fortune the
Restorer, and upon this altar it ordered that the <em>pontifices</em> and
the Vestal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> virgins should offer sacrifice yearly on the anniversary of
the day on which I returned into the city from Syria, in the consulship
of Quintus Lucretius and Marcus Vinucius, and it called the day the

<p>By a decree of the senate at the same time a part of the prætors and

time has been decreed to no one but me.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> When I returned from Spain
and Gaul after successfully arranging the affairs of those provinces,
in the consulship of Tiberius Nero and Publius Quintilius, the senate
voted that in honor of my return an altar of the Augustan Peace should
be consecrated in the Campus Martius, and upon this altar it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span> ordered

<p>For the lands which in my fourth consulship, and afterwards in the
consulship of Marcus Crassus and Cnæus Lentulus, the augur, I assigned
to soldiers, I paid money to the <em>municipia</em>. The sum which I paid
for Italian farms was about six hundred million sesterces, and that for
lands in the provinces was about two hundred and sixty millions.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a>
Of all those who have established colonies of soldiers in Italy or
in the provinces I am the first and only one within the memory of my

Cnæus Piso, and also in that of Gaius Antistius and Decimus Lælius,
and in that of Gaius Calvisius and Lucius Pasienus, and in that of
Lucius Lentulus and Marcus Messala, and in that of Lucius Caninius and

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">1</a> This title at Ancyra extends over the first three pages of
the Latin, that is over so much of the inscription as is on the left
wall of the pronaos; the Greek title extends over seventeen of the
nineteen pages of the Greek version.</p>

<p class="noindent">In its present form, the title cannot be the same as that over the
original at Rome. All from “as engraved” is certainly an addition,
probably made by the Galatian legate who ordered the magistrates of
Ancyra to have the inscription placed on the temple of Augustus.
The last two words in the Latin (placed first in the English), were
probably inserted only by a blunder at Ancyra. “A copy subjoined,”
doubtless stood in the legate’s letter, just as we might write “see
enclosure.” But what of the remainder of the inscription, “Of the deeds
... Roman people”? It is hardly conceivable that this was the title
of the inscription at Rome, because it embraces only two of the three
parts into which the subject-matter falls. It covers the achievements
and the expenditures of Augustus; in reverse order, however, from that
of the document itself; and it omits any allusion to the subject-matter
of the first fourteen chapters, which have to do with the offices and
honors conferred upon Augustus.</p>

<p class="noindent">It is impossible to say what was the superscription at Rome. Possibly
there was none. The name of Augustus, most likely, was conspicuous
somewhere in connection with the front of the mausoleum, and this
inscription may very well have been devoid of title.</p></div>

before the disuse of the dictatorship. Cf. Livy III, 4; VI, 19. This

<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">16</a> The only instance in the Res Gestae of a palpable
distortion of fact. The battles at Philippi, in November, 712, are
referred to. For the date see Gardthausen, <cite>Aug.</cite> 2er Th. 1er
Halbband, p. 80. In the first fight, Suetonius says (<cite>Aug.</cite> 13),
that Cæsar hardly escaped, ill and naked, from his camp to the wing of
Antony’s army. He was ill, and had to be carried in a litter, according
to Plutarch, <cite>Brut.</cite> p. 41. In <cite>Antony</cite>, 22, Plutarch says:
“In the first battle, Cæsar was completely routed by Brutus, his camp
taken, he himself very narrowly escaping by flight.” The decisive
defeat of the Republicans was twenty days later.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">17</a> The text here is conjectural. Mommsen is almost alone
in holding to “surviving,” Zumpt, in his edition of 1869, had read
“suppliant” (<em>supplicibus</em>), Bergk, in 1873, “asking pardon”
(<em>deprecantibus</em>). Hirschfeld, the same sense, (<em>veniam
petentibus</em>). Seeck insists on the latter reading, in spite of
Mommsen’s arguments for his own choice. Augustus did not spare all
surviving citizens either after Philippi or Actium, cf. Dio LI, 2:
After Actium “of the senators and knights, and other leading men, who
in any way had helped Antony, he fined some, many he killed, some he
spared.” For his conduct after Philippi, cf. Suet. <cite>Aug.</cite> 13. But
a coin of 727 (Eckhel VI, 88, Cohen I, p. 66, No. 30), has <span class="smcap">Cæsar
cos vii Civibus Servateis</span>, “Cæsar for the seventh time consul, the
citizens having been preserved.” It commemorates the civic crown given
to Augustus, cf. c. XXXIV. There are other coins with <span class="smcap">Ob Cives
Servatos</span>, “On account of the preservation of the citizens.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="label">18</a> This fact is one of the few which the latest text, based
on Humann’s work, alone establishes. Merivale’s comment on the relation
of Augustus to the army is noteworthy: “Their hero (Julius Cæsar)
discarded the defence of the legions, and a few months witnessed his
assassination. Augustus learned circumspection from the failure of his
predecessor’s enterprise. He organized a military establishment of
which he made himself the permanent head; to him every legionary swore
personal fidelity; every officer depended upon his direct appointment.”
(C. XXXII.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">19</a> C. 15 states the number colonized at 120,000. The
200,000 over and above the 300,000 here named, are accounted for in
the twenty-five legions, 150,000 men in service at his death, leaving
only 50,000 as the number who died in service or were dishonorably
discharged during the long rule of Augustus. For a study of the
strength and disposition of the Roman army at the death of Augustus,
cf. Mommsen’s R. G., pp. 67-76.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">20</a> The term of service in 741, was twelve years for
praetorian soldiers and sixteen for legionaries, raised in 758 to
sixteen and twenty years respectively. Cf. c. 17, N. 2.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">21</a> The reading of Wölfflin and others (see textual note)
would give instead of “lands purchased by me,” “I have assigned lands,”
and instead of “money for farms, out of my own means” “money for reward
of service.” Bormann, <cite>Schr. Nachl.</cite> p. 18-20, does not think
that Augustus meant to state that he paid these charges from private
sources, but believes that such a statement would be irrelevant in this
section, if true, and an anticipation of cc. 15 and 16.</p>

success in war, must be carefully distinguished from the title used as
a prefix to the name and as a mark of perpetual authority. The title
imperator was regularly and permanently assumed at the beginning of
each reign, after that of Augustus. To him it was formally assigned
by the senate, in Jan., 725. C. I. L., V, 1873: <em>Senatus populusque
Romanus imp. Cæsari, divi. Juli. f. cos. quinct. cos. design. sext.
imp. sept. republica conservata.</em> The term thus had a double usage
and meaning in such cases.</p>

<p class="noindent">It soon came about that only the <em>princeps</em> could assume the
special designation for military successes, no matter whether won by
him in person or not. Tacitus says, <cite>Ann.</cite> III, 74: “Tiberius
allowed Blaesus to be saluted as imperator by the legions. Augustus
conceded the title to some, but Tiberius’ allowing it to Blaesus was
the last instance.” For a discussion of <em>Imperator</em> as permanent
title, see Gardthausen, p. 527, and Merivale, <cite>History of the
Romans</cite>, c. XXXI.</p>

Tiberius was associated.</p>

Agrippa entered his consulship Jan. 1, 717.</p>

<p class="foot25">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IV. Probably connected with the Sicilian victory and ovation of 718.</p>

<p class="foot25">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; V. 720 or 721. Probably connected with Dalmatian victories of one of
those years. Cf. C. I. L. V, 526.</p>

<p class="foot25">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VI. From Sept. 2, 723, to 725. On account of Actium. Cf. Oros. VI,
19, 14. C. I. L. X, 3826. <cite>Imp. Cæsari divi f. imp. vi, cos.

<p class="foot25">&nbsp; &nbsp; VII. From 725 to 729. C. I. L. VI, 873: <cite>senatus populusque Romanus
imp. Cæsari divi Juli f. cos. quinct.</cite> (725) <cite>cos. desig. sex.
imp. sept. republica conservata</cite>. On account of Thracian and
Dacian victory of M. Licinius Crassus. Dio LI, 25, says: “Sacrifices
and festivals were decreed to Cæsar and to Crassus. He did not,
however, as some say, take the name imperator. Cæsar alone assumed
that.”</p>

<p class="foot25">&nbsp; &nbsp; VIII. From 729 to 734. Two inscriptions at Nismes (Donat. 96,
6) read: <em>imp. Cæsari divi f. Augusto cos. nonum</em> (729)
<em>designato decimum, imp. octavum</em>. Dio LIII, 26, says it was for
a Celtic victory of Marcus Vinicius.</p>

<p class="foot25">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IX. From 734 to 739 (?) Coins have the inscription <cite>Augustus Cæsar
div. f. Armen. capt. imp. viii</cite>. These commemorate the Armenian
expedition of Tiberius in 734. Possibly Augustus took the title on
account of the return of the captured standards from Parthia, which
he accounted a greater triumph than many a victory in open warfare.</p>

<p class="foot25">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; X. 739 (?) to 742. C. I. L. V, 8088 and others: <cite>Augustus imp. x,
tribunicia potestate xi</cite>. The latter falls in the years 742, 743.
Probably referable to successes in Rhætian war of 739.</p>

<p class="foot25">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XI. 742. Coins (Cohen, n. 147-150) give: <cite>imp. xi</cite>. The causes
were the successes of Tiberius in Pannonia in 742. Dio LIV, 31.</p>

received the oration for Pannonian and Dalmatian victories. Cf. Val.
5, 5, 3. Dio LV, 2.</p>

<p class="foot25">&nbsp; &nbsp; XIV. Tiberius Imp. II. 746-755. Dio LV, 6, refers this acclamation
to the Germanic victories of 746. Many coins, milestones and other
inscriptions of the period indicated mention this fourteenth
acclamation. Cf. C. I. L., II, 3827; 4931; V, 7243; 7817; VI, 1244.</p>

<p class="foot25">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;XV. 755. For the Armenian victory of C. Cæsar. Dio Cass. LV, 11. C.

expedition of Tiberius in 759, says, “Nothing great was accomplished.
Yet both Augustus and Tiberius received the acclamation as
imperators.” Cf. C. I. L. V. 6416.</p>

<p class="foot25">XVIII. Tiberius Imp. IV. Probably for successes in Illyricum.</p>

<p class="foot25">&nbsp; XIX. Tiberius Imp. V, 762. Dio LVI, 17, refers to the Dalmatian war.
A coin of 763-4 (Cohen n. 27) gives: <em>Ti. Cæsar August. f, imperat.
v. pontifex, tribun. potestate xii</em>.</p>

<p class="foot25">&nbsp; &nbsp; XX. Tiberius Imp. VI. 765. The cause is not clear, probably for
slight successes of Tiberius and Germanicus against the Germans in
763, 764. Dio LVI, 25. A Spanish milestone, C. I. L. II, 4868, gives
the data.</p>

<p class="foot25">&nbsp; XXI. Tiberius Imp. VII. Tac. <cite>Ann.</cite> I, 9, says Augustus was
twenty-one times Imperator. A coin of Lyons (Cohen n. 35-38) has:
<em>Ti. Cæsar Augusti f. imperator VII</em>. This dates from the
lifetime of Augustus. Tiberius did not receive a further acclamation.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31" class="label">31</a> The emperors assumed the consulship only irregularly and
for short periods. Their taking of the “tribunitial power” was not
through a regular election to the tribuneship, as was the case with
the consulship, for Augustus as a patrician was ineligible; but it was
the assumption of a power equal to that of the tribunes. This made the
emperors sacrosanct, gave them the initiative and the veto, and well
subserved the fiction of their being the representatives and champions
of the people. For discussions of this power cf. Merivale, <cite>Hist. of
Rom.</cite> C. XXXI; Mommsen, <cite>Röm. St.</cite> II, p. 759, 771-777, 833-845.</p>

<p class="noindent">Succeeding emperors, down to 268 A. D., dated their accession from
the day of assuming the tribunitial power. The wording is peculiar in
this sentence. May it not have been that Augustus expected his heir
or executors to fill in the exact dates at the time of his death, as
suggested in the introduction?</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_32" href="#FNanchor_32" class="label">32</a> Dio, LIV, 1, writes: “In the following year (732)
the Tiber again overflowed; statues in the Pantheon were struck by
lightning, so that the spear was knocked out of the hand of Augustus.
Pestilence was so violent in all Italy that year that there was no
one to till the fields; and I think the same was the case in foreign
lands. The Romans thought that this plague and famine had come upon
them, because they had not made Augustus consul that year; they wished
to name him dictator, and with great show of violence compelled the
senate, shut up in the curia, to decree this; threatening to burn
them unless they did it. So the senate approached Augustus with the
twenty-four fasces (insignia of dictatorship, the consul having
only twelve), and begged him to accept the dictatorship and the
administration of the food supply. He did indeed undertake the latter
charge, and ordered that duumvirs, who had held the praetorship
five years before, should be yearly appointed to have charge of the
distribution of grain, but would by no means accept the dictatorship.
When neither by words nor prayers he could move the people, he tore
his garments. For he justly wished to avoid the jealousy and hatred of
that name, since moreover, he already held a dignity and power superior
to that of the dictatorship.” Vell. II, 89, 5, says: “The dictatorship
which the people persistently thrust upon him, he as constantly
repelled.”</p>

<p class="noindent">The dictatorship had fallen into disuse after 552, and was revived,
irregularly, by Sulla in 672. Cæsar made it the basis of his power,
being made perpetual dictator shortly before his death. After that
event, on motion of Antony, the office was abolished.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="label">33</a> In Chap. 15, Augustus states that in 731 he twelve times
distributed grain at his own expense. This assumption of the grain
administration in 732 was not strictly a charity. The extract from
Dio under Note <a href="#Footnote_69">69</a>, gives some of the details. It is probable that from
this time the tribute in kind was turned into the <em>fiscus</em>, or
imperial treasury, instead of into the <em>ærarium</em>, or treasury of
the senate, as heretofore. This new task of the imperial government
involved not merely the gratuitous distribution of grain to the
ordinary Roman citizens (after 752 even to senators and knights), but
also the providing of a sufficient supply of grain for all purchasers
at a minimum price, often below the market value. It appears that grain
tickets “tessaræ frumentariæ” were distributed to the citizens entitled
to free grain, and then, to assist the vast multitude of strangers,
freedmen, and <em>attachés</em> of the great houses, money tickets,
“tessaræ nummariæ” were given out. Cf. Mommsen, <cite>Röm. St.</cite>, II,
992.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_34" href="#FNanchor_34" class="label">34</a> Vell. II, 89; Suet. <cite>Aug.</cite> 26; Dio, LIV, 10. Dio’s
statement that Augustus in 735 accepted the consular power (differing
from the consulship as the tribunitial power from the tribuneship. Cf.
Note <a href="#Footnote_31">31</a>, Chap. 4.) for life, cannot be correct in face of the other two
authorities cited, who corroborate Augustus here. Chapter 8 tells of
two special assumptions of the consular power for the taking of the
second and third census.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_35" href="#FNanchor_35" class="label">35</a> Before the restoration of the text of this inscription,
in this case depending entirely upon the remains at Apollonia, it used
to be taught that Augustus accepted the formal superintendence of
laws and morals. And there seemed to be good ground for such belief.
Horace, c., 740 in <cite>Carm. IV</cite>, 5, v. 22, says, “Morality and law
have subdued foul wrong;” and in <cite>Ep.</cite>, II, 1, v. 1, “Since thou
hast protected Italy with arms, adorned her with morality, and improved
her with laws.” Ovid wrote, <cite>Tristia</cite>, II, 233: “The city wearies
thee with the care of laws and morals, which thou desirest should be
like thy own.” Suet. <cite>Aug.</cite> 27, says: “He accepted the control of
laws and morals for life, as he had the tribunitial power; and in the
exercise of this control, altho’ without the honor of the censorship,
he yet thrice took the census of the people, the first and third times
with a colleague, the second time alone.” Dio, LIV, 10, 30, says that
in 735 and 742 Augustus accepted this office for periods of five years.
But the inscription shows that Suetonius and Dio were wrong, and that a
natural but incorrect inference had been drawn from the poets.</p>

<p class="noindent">This power was offered to Augustus three times; in 735, 736 and 743,
and as often refused. Why was it offered, and why refused? Cf. Dio,
LIV, 10; Vell. II, 91, 92; Suet. <cite>Aug.</cite> 19. While Augustus was in
Asia in 735 M. Egnatius Rufus, who is painted as a sort of Catiline,
tried to obtain the consulship, and even to supplant Augustus, and
stirred up sedition in the attempt. This so alarmed the senate and
people that they offered Augustus the plenary power of legislation and
coercion. The repetition of the offer in 736 was from a similar cause.
The reason for that of 743 is unknown. The power thus offered was
analogous to the decemvirate, or the Sullan dictatorship. Cf. Mommsen,
<cite>Röm.</cite>, St., II, 686.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36" class="label">36</a> This sentence answers the second question asked in the
above Note. It was part of Augustus’ policy to seem to keep wholly
within the lines of the constitution. Hence his refusal to accept
any extraordinary office. Yet his tribunitial power was new and
extraordinary. Tacitus’ comment is caustic, <cite>Ann.</cite>, III, 56:
“That specious title (the tribunitial power) importing nothing less
than sovereign power, was invented by Augustus at a time when the name
of king or dictator was not only unconstitutional but universally
detested. And yet a new name was wanted to overtop the magistrates and
the forms of the constitution.”</p>

senior senator who had served as censor. Its only privilege was the
right of speaking first in debate. The honor had fallen into abeyance
with the death of Catulus in 694. It is readily seen how the revival
of such a title and of the right to express his views before any other
senator, gave Augustus a quasi-constitutional initiative in the senate.
Gradually the title dropped its second part, and “prince” began to have
something of its modern significance. Cf. Tacitus, <cite>Ann.</cite> III, 53,

An earlier creation of patricians is assigned by Dio to the year 721.
But he is probably mistaken, as Tacitus, in the passage just noted,
says that Claudius was obliged to create more patricians, “because the
number had declined even after being recruited by the dictator Cæsar
under the Cassian law, and by Augustus the <em>princeps</em> under the
Saenian law.” Such a creation was not a right of the principate. Cæsar
and Augustus did it by special authorization of people and senate.
Claudius did it in virtue of his censorship, and this status continued
till Domitian absorbed the censorship in the principate, and assumed
the right as a permanent one.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_49" href="#FNanchor_49" class="label">49</a> During most of the republican history the senate
numbered, ideally, three hundred. In Cicero’s time it had over four
hundred members. Julius Cæsar raised it to about nine hundred. Suet.
<cite>Aug.</cite>, 35, says: “By two separate scrutinies he (Augustus)
reduced to their former number and splendor the senate, which had been
swamped by a disorderly crowd; for they were now more than a thousand,
and some of them very mean persons, who, after Cæsar’s death, had been
chosen by dint of interest and bribery, so that they had the name of
Orcini among the people.” They were also called Charonites, because
they owed their elevation to the last will of Cæsar, who had gone into
Orcus to Charon. Dio, XL, 48, 63, tells of freedmen in the senate and,
XLIII, 22, of a private soldier; Gell., XV, 4, of a muleteer, cf.
Juvenal, <cite>Sat.</cite> VII, 199.</p>

<p class="noindent">Dio, LII, 42, cf. LIII, 1, tells of the first scrutiny, in 725-6. A
hint from Augustus was enough to cause the withdrawal first of sixty,
then of one hundred and forty senators. He also tells, LIV, 13, 14,
of a further revision in 736, by which the number was brought down to
six hundred. He assigns a third sifting to 743 (LIV, 35), and a fourth
to 757 (LV, 13). Mommsen, however, is inclined to connect the three
revisions of Augustus with the censuses of 726, 746 and 767, and to
regard those of 736 and 757 as extraordinary, and therefore not named
by Augustus, in his desire to appear entirely within constitutional
lines. Cf. Mommsen, <cite>R. G.</cite>, p. 35.</p>

The number of Roman citizens of military age in 684 had been given
as but 450,000. This census of 726 reported 4,063,000. Probably the
vast apparent increase rose from the fact of the earlier enumeration
counting only such as presented themselves before the censors in the
city, while at the later time the citizens throughout the empire were
counted. Clinton, <cite>Fasti Hellenici</cite>, III, 461, estimates a total
free citizenship of more than 17,000,000. The total population of the
empire at this time, including citizens, allies, slaves and freedmen,
has been estimated at 85,000,000. Cf. Merivale, <cite>Rom.</cite> cc. XXX,

extract verbatim, and give to his domestics, or send to the commanders
of the armies, the governors of the provinces, or the magistrates of
the city, when any of them seemed to stand in need of admonition. He
likewise read whole books to the senate, and frequently made them known
to the people by his edicts; such as the orations of Quintus Metellus
‘For the Encouragement of Marriage,’ and those of Rutilius ‘On the

were decreed to him, but that he would accept none of them, “but that
an altar should be consecrated to Fortune the Restorer, that the day

was possible. In consequence of this the senate sent messengers to
Augustus urging him to deal with the trouble. Q. Lucretius, one of the
delegates, was named consul by Augustus on the spot where they met. It
is Mommsen’s idea (<cite>R. G.</cite>, p. 48) that the story of Dio, and the
statement of Augustus relate to the same event, and that Augustus was
not willing to admit that so late in his reign, such disturbances could
be, and that he therefore conveys the impression that what was really
an appeal for aid was rather an embassy of honor. This Mommsen thinks
quite in keeping with the general character and method of Augustus.
Bormann, on the other hand (<cite>Schr. Nach.</cite>, p. 29), sees no
conflict in the two accounts. He believes that Dio narrates truthfully
enough an earlier deputation sent to Augustus, possibly at Athens, some
time before his return, and that Lucretius was named consul there by
Augustus. Then, some time later, the deputation of honor, as recorded
in the inscription, was sent into Campania.</p>

the war with the Cantabri. Cf. Dio, LIII, 26, Plutarch, l. c. A second
time it was closed in 729, cf. Dio, l. c.; Oros., VI, 21, 1. The time
of its next opening cannot be determined; but in all probability it was
reopened that very year, on account of the Arabian campaign. Dio, LIV,
36, records that in 744 the Senate decreed that it should be closed,
but that a Dacian rebellion interfered. But Dio must be mistaken, for
Drusus was then in the midst of his German campaign. But after the
campaigns of Drusus and Tiberius in Germany, closed in 746, up to 753,
when Gaius Cæsar started for Armenia, the temple might well have been
closed. Parts of Dio are lost here, which may have mentioned such
closing. The birth of Jesus Christ, 749, falls in this period of peace.
Cf. Milton’s <cite>Nativity Hymn</cite>. When it was opened for the third
time cannot be said. Tacitus says it was opened when Augustus was an
old man. But it can hardly have remained shut after the opening of the
Armenian war in 753. Augustus was then sixty-two years old. That age
may possibly suit the expression of Tacitus. Horace <cite>Ep.</cite>, II, 1,
255, and <cite>Carm.</cite>, IV, 15, 9, mentions the closing of the temple.
Suetonius, <cite>Aug.</cite> 22, says: “Janus Quirinus, which had been shut
twice only, from the era of the building of the city to his own time,
he closed thrice in a much shorter period, having established universal
peace both by sea and land.” This is almost a literal transcript of the

daughter of Augustus, were born, the one in 734 (Dio, LIV, 8), the
other in 737 (Dio, LIV, 18) and were adopted by their grandfather
immediately after the birth of the latter. Dio, LIV, 18, says: “Lucius
and his brother Gaius, Augustus at once adopted and made heirs of the
empire, without waiting till they grew to manhood, in order that he
might be the more secure against conspiracies.” The will of Augustus
(Suet. <cite>Tib.</cite> 23), speaks much as this chapter does of the death
of the two Cæsars: “Since harsh fortune has snatched from me my sons,
Gaius and Lucius, let Tiberius Cæsar be heir to two-thirds of my
estate.” Suetonius, <cite>Aug.</cite> 26, says that Augustus took his twelfth
and thirteenth consulships, for the purpose of introducing these two
boys into the forum.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_66" href="#FNanchor_66" class="label">66</a> Dio, LV, 9, under the year 748 writes that these lads
were wild and insolent and that the younger, then eleven years old,
actually proposed to the people to make Gaius consul. Augustus appeared
very angry at this, saying it would be a public calamity for the
consulship to be borne by one of less age than that at which he himself
had assumed it, viz., twenty. Gaius was, however, designated consul
in 749, and Lucius in 752. Cf. Tac. <cite>Ann.</cite> I, 3; a coin of Rome
has on one side: <em>Cæsar Augustus, divi. f., pater patriæ</em>; on the
other: <em>C. L. Cæsares, Augusti f., cos. desig., princ. juvent.</em>
(Eckhel VI, 171). This must have been struck between Feb. 5, 752, when
Augustus received the title <em>pater patriæ</em>, and January 1, 754,

and the golden (sic) shields and spears, which they had received from
the knights when they assumed the <em>toga virilis</em>, were suspended
in the curia.”</p>

<p class="noindent">The title of <em>princeps juventutis</em> is somewhat difficult to
explain. The fact is attested by Zonaras, X, 35, and by an inscription
found near Viterbo (cf. Mommsen <cite>R. G.</cite>, p. 53), which reads:
<em>C. Cæsari Aug. f.d.n. pontif. cos. design. principi juventut</em>,
“To Caius Cæsar, son of Augustus, nephew of the divine (Julius)
pontifex, consul designate, prince of the youth.” Mommsen sums up his
investigation of this (Cf. <cite>R. G.</cite> p. 54, ff.): the knights were
divided into <em>turmæ</em>, or troops, each officered by <em>seviri</em>,
three <em>decurions</em> and three <em>optios</em> or adjutants. Gaius
and Lucius were <em>decurions</em> of the first <em>turma</em>, and their
title, “princes of the youth,” was a special one, and always thereafter
reserved for members of the imperial family. The title does not appear
to have been official, or formally bestowed, but was given by common
consent of the knights.</p>

to the Roman people his gardens near the Tiber, and three hundred
sesterces to each man.” Dio, XLIV, 35, is peculiar, saying: “Cæsar left
to the people his gardens on the Tiber, and to each man one hundred
and twenty sesterces, as Augustus himself says, or as others say,
three hundred sesterces apiece.” May it be that Dio has reversed the
facts here, and that it was “others” who reported the smaller sum and
Augustus the larger? Augustus is substantiated, or followed, by Plut.;

people a hundred denarii (four hundred sesterces) apiece, but forbade
the distribution until his act should receive the sanction of the
senate.” It would seem to have been unlawful to give money to the
people without the consent of the senate. Probably this was a measure
of precaution against demagogues.</p>

<p class="noindent">The term <em>congiarium</em>, which is transferred rather than

this inscription was prepared about 750. In this draft Augustus first
mentioned all his gifts to the city people; and at the end placed the
one gift to the soldiers. Then, when in 767, the document was brought

<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_80" href="#FNanchor_80" class="label">80</a> The dates are 747, 748, 750, 751 and 752. The amount is
$20,000,000. It was in 741 (Dio, LIV, 25) that Augustus determined upon
a gift in money as a substitute for the assignments of land customary
up to that time. Why such payments began only in 747 is a matter of
conjecture; also why they ceased after 752. Probably because the years
742-746 were occupied with the German and Pannonian wars of Tiberius
and Drusus, and either there were no discharges, or else no money to
spare from the expenses of war. Again in 753 troubles began in the
East.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_81" href="#FNanchor_81" class="label">81</a> Only two of these occasions can be traced. Dio, LIII, 2, mentions
one. He says that in 726, when it was determined to exhibit games in
honor of Actium, Augustus replenished the empty treasury for that
purpose. And there is a coin of c. 738 with the inscription: <em>Senatus
populusque Romanus imperatori Cæsari quod viæ munitæ sunt ex ea pecunia
quam is ad ærarium detulit.</em> Eckhel VI, 105.</p>

<p class="noindent">Up to 726 the treasury was in charge of the quæstors. Thence to 731 two
exprætors, after that year two prætors presided over it, up to the time
of Claudius. Cf. Tac. <cite>Ann.</cite> XIII, 29; Dio, LIII, 2 and 32; Suet.
<cite>Aug.</cite> 36. The sum mentioned here is $7,500,000. In the Greek
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρίς</span> has evidently been omitted before <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χειλίας</span>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_82" href="#FNanchor_82" class="label">82</a> This was in 759. In 741 (Dio, LIV, 25) Augustus had fixed the
term of service at twelve years for the prætorians and sixteen for
the legionaries. The gift to the former upon discharge was also
larger. In 758 the terms of service were lengthened to sixteen and
twenty years. Cf. Dio, LV, 23. In LV, 25, Dio writes of this year 759:
“Augustus contributed, in his own name and in that of Tiberius, money
for that treasury which is called the military.” The sum so given was
$8,500,000. Tributary states and kings also assisted. But income could
not keep pace with expenses. The old tax of a twentieth on bequests,
except when the heir was a very near relative, or very poor, was
revived, much to the discontent of the Roman people. Cf. Dio, LV, 25. Other
taxes were devised, such as that of one <em>per cent</em> on sales. Cf.
Tac. <cite>Ann.</cite> I, 78. On sales of slaves two <em>per cent</em> was
exacted. Cf. Dio, LV, 31.</p>

<p class="noindent">A glance at the military establishment of Augustus may help to some
idea of its vast expense. Mommsen discusses the matter in detail (<cite>R.
G.</cite> pp. 68-76). Augustus seems to have left at his death a standing
army of twenty-five legions. Each legion approximated seven thousand
men, giving a total of 175,000 soldiers. His legions were numbered from
one to twenty-two. The number twenty-five is accounted for as follows:
the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth had been exterminated
under the leadership of Varus. But there were three legions, one in
Africa, one in Syria and one in Cyrenaica, bearing the title third,
and the fourth, fifth, sixth and tenth were each double. After Actium,
Augustus disbanded the legions numbered above twelve (cf. his colonies
of veterans at this time, numbering 120,000 men, c. XV). But by reason
of the repetitions above alluded to, the legions bearing the numbers
up to twelve, really amounted to eighteen. These duplications may have
risen from the absorption into Augustus’ army of legions bearing the
same numbers from the forces of Lepidus and later from those of Antony.
In 759, eight new legions, the thirteenth to the twentieth, seem to
have been enrolled, in view of the German and Pannonian wars. This made
twenty six. Three were lost with Varus, and their numbers, seventeen,
eighteen and nineteen, seem never to have been restored to the list.
To offset this loss in a measure, two new legions, the twenty-first
and twenty-second were levied. Thus the twenty-five remaining at the
death of Augustus are accounted for. Such an establishment was
enormously and increasingly expensive. Pliny, <cite>Hist. Nat.</cite>, VII,
45.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_83" href="#FNanchor_83" class="label">83</a> This form of benefaction began in 736. It is a little
remarkable that Augustus should not mention the exact years of its
continuance, its amount, or the beneficiaries, while he does name the
minimum number of men who received aid from time to time. Perhaps he
did not go into details because these gifts concerned the provincials
and would be of slight interest to the city people for whose reading
the inscription was intended. In 742, “when Asia was in need of aid on
account of earthquakes, he paid the year’s tribute of the province out
of his own means.” Dio, LIV, 30.</p>

<p class="noindent">His supplying grain as well as money rose from the fact that taxes
were imposed both in kind and in money. Cf. Tac. <cite>Ann.</cite> IV, 6;
<cite>Agr.</cite> XIX and XXXI; C. I. Gr. 4957, 47. These passages all speak
of taxes both in money and in produce. As to the method of levy,
Hyginus is interesting (<cite>De Lim.</cite> p. 205). “The tax on agriculture
is arranged in many ways. In some provinces the harvest is chargeable
with a certain proportion, here a fifth, there a seventh, elsewhere
a cash payment, and for this purpose certain values are determined
for the fields by an estimation of the soil; as in Pannonia there is
arable of the first class, of the second, meadows, mast-bearing woods,
common woods, pastures: upon all these the tax is laid by the single
acre, according to the fertility of the soil.” This was in the time of
Trajan.</p>

Gellius, XV, 5. The word really means wretched rather than unfinished.

“<em>constructed</em>” the Flaminian Way, etc., for it was made nearly
two hundred years before this date, 727. Moreover, the whole chapter is
given up to an account of reconstructions, and of course it is meant
that he <em>repaired</em> the road and the bridges in question. The
Latin verb is wanting and is restored from the Greek, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπόησα</span>,
which is unmistakable,—“I made.” Mommsen does not comment on the
incorrectness of this statement, but Wölfflin regards the Greek verb
as a blunder of the stone-cutter at Ancyra, and thinks there was no
verb at all at the end of this chapter, but that the mason by mistake
took the last word of the preceding chapter which is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπόησα</span>. A

With him Germanicus, nephew and adopted son of Tiberius, and Drusus,
Tiberius’ own son, became the legal grandchildren of Augustus. None of
these could celebrate games in his own name after adoption, as they had
no property rights, but were absolutely dependent on the head of their
house, according to the <em>patria potestas</em> of the Roman law. See
this very plainly set forth in Suetonius, <cite>Tib.</cite> 15: “After his
(Tiberius’) adoption he never again acted as master of a family, nor
exercised in the smallest degree the rights which he had lost by it.
For he neither disposed of anything in the way of gift, nor manumitted
a slave; nor so much as received an estate left him by will, or any

while distinctly referring to him. Antony had stripped various temples
at Samos, Ephesus, Pergamos, and Rhœteum, all in the province of Asia,
and had given the spoils to Cleopatra. Dio, LI, 17, says that great
numbers of such things were found in her palace when Alexandria was
captured. Pliny, <cite>Hist. Nat.</cite>, XXXIV, 8, 58, says: “He (Myro) made
an Apollo, which was taken away by the triumvir Antony, but restored
to the Ephesians by the divine Augustus.” Strabo, XIII, 1, 30, writes
of Rhœteum: “Cæsar Augustus gave back to the Rhœtians the shrine and
statue of Ajax which Antony had taken away and given to Egypt. He did
the like for other cities. For Antony took away the finest votive
offerings from the most famous shrines for the gratification of the
Egyptian woman, but Augustus restored them.” Ib. XIV, 1, 14, writes of
the temple of Hera, at Samos: “Antony took away three colossal sitting
statues on one base, but Augustus Cæsar restored two of them, Athene
and Heracles, to the same base; the Zeus, however, he placed upon the
Capitol.”</p>

it remarkable that a son of the great Pompey, who had freed the sea
from pirates, should himself defile it with piratical crimes. Florus,
IV, 8, reflects the same sentiment. App. <em>B. C.</em>, V, 77, 80, says
that captured pirates under torture confessed that Sextus Pompeius was
the instigator of their crimes. When the peace of Misenum was made,
Sextus Pompeius stipulated for the freedom of the slaves who had fought
under him. It was after the overthrow of Pompey, in 718, that the
slaves were returned. Dio, XLIX, 12, adds that slaves whose masters
did not claim them were returned to their several cities, there to be

Taking the provinces in order we find: First, the German frontier is
pushed forward from the Rhine to the Elbe. Cf. Suet. <cite>Aug.</cite> 21.
Second, in Illyricum and Macedonia he had erected the new provinces
of Pannonia and Moesia. Third, in Asia Minor he did not extend the
older limits of Bithynia, but out of the kingdom of Amyntas, he made
the new province of Galatia and later added Paphlagonia to it. Fourth,
in Africa, Augustus rather narrowed than extended the empire by his
partition with Juba in 729. But a number of Roman proconsuls won
laurels there.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_122" href="#FNanchor_122" class="label">122</a> Here the record is of commotions quelled within the

war from 727 to 735. In Gaul, G. Carrinas had subdued the Morini, and
triumphed, July 14, 726; and M. Messala had suppressed the Aquitani,
triumphing Sept. 25, 727. Cf. Suet. <cite>Aug.</cite>, 20, 21.</p>

<p class="noindent">The German campaigns extending at intervals over the years from 742
to the very end of Augustus’ reign it is needless to detail. This
reference to the pacification of Germany has been the subject of
much dispute. Mommsen in two places (<cite>R. G.</cite>, p. VI, and 48),
uses the word “crafty” (<em>callidus</em>) of Augustus, referring to
his alleged glozing over of unsatisfactory events. Hirschfeld goes
further, and in connection with the present passage accuses Augustus
(<cite>Wiener Studien</cite>, V, 117) of a “masterly concealment and
whitewashing (übertünchung) of all that could hurt his reputation.”
This charge is made because Augustus omits all mention of the disaster
under Varus. Against this charge Johannes Schmidt defends Augustus,
(<cite>Philologus</cite>, XLV, p. 394, ff.). The contest between Schmidt and
Hirschfeld is based really upon opposing views of the purpose of the
<em>Res Gestae</em>. Schmidt believed it to be an epitaph. In this there
would be no place for anything save the fortunate events of a life.
If <em>nil de mortuis nisi bonum</em> be wise, Augustus might well have
adapted the adage to his own case and said, <em>nil de me morituro nisi
bonum</em>. But Hirschfeld insists that the <em>Res Gestae</em> constitute
not an epitaph, but “an account of his administration,” and therefore
contends that the omission of the German disaster was not in good
faith. To this, Schmidt answers that Augustus had nothing to gain by
such concealment—indeed that concealment of so notorious a disaster
would be absurd. And in the text itself he finds a recognition of the
real state of affairs, inasmuch as Augustus expressly distinguishes
Germany from the provinces, Gallic and Spanish, and while claiming
it for Rome, does not assert that it belongs to her as do organized
provinces. Schmidt also says that <em>pacavi</em>, “I pacified” does
not necessarily imply that Germany continued in a state of peace. It
may well enough cover the fact that there was temporary success. But
this is hair-splitting. The character of the <em>Res Gestae</em> must
be always had in mind. Cf. Introduction. Its deliverances were <em>ad
populum</em> and they constituted an epitaph.</p>

after Actium and the death of Cleopatra, in 724. Its connection
with the empire was peculiar. W. T. Arnold, <cite>Roman Provincial
Administration</cite>, p. 113, says: “The government of Egypt was in many
points wholly exceptional. Julius Cæsar had deliberately abstained from
making it a province of the country (cf. Suet., <cite>Jul.</cite> 35); and
when Augustus added it to the empire he subjected it to an altogether
exceptional treatment. The country was his private property, or rather
the Emperor’s private property; it passed as a matter of course, that
is, from emperor to emperor. Augustus appointed a præfect to represent
him in the province, just as in earlier times the urban prætors had
sent prefects to represent them in the municipalities of Italy. This
præfect was of equestrian, and not of the highest equestrian rank (Tac.
<cite>Ann.</cite>, XII, 60; II, 59; <cite>Hist.</cite> I. 11); no senators were
admitted into the province; and the greatest jealousy was shown of the
smallest interference with it. The reasons for the special jealousy
of Egypt shown by Augustus and his successors were partly the great
defensibility of the country (in case of insurrection—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>),
partly its immense importance as the granary of Rome. ‘It was an
accepted principle with our fathers,’ says Pliny, ‘that our city could
not possibly be fed and maintained without the resources of Egypt.’”

<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_129" href="#FNanchor_129" class="label">129</a> Armenia Major had been raised to greatness by Tigranes I
(658-699) who had been a formidable ally of Mithridates. Pompey finally
subdued him, 688. Henceforth Armenia was in a subject condition.
Tigranes was succeeded by his son Artavasdes. In 718, when Antony
attacked the Parthians, this king sided with him against Phraates of
Parthia, and another Artavasdes, king of Media. Cf. Dio, XLIX, 25.</p>

<p class="noindent">But presently the two Artavasdes changed relations, the king of Armenia
passing to the Parthian side and he of Media joining Antony. Cf.
Plut., <cite>Ant.</cite>, 52; Dio, XLIX, 33, 44. Antony captured Artavasdes
of Armenia and gave him over to Cleopatra, who killed him in 721. His
kingdom was assigned to Antony’s son Alexander to whom was betrothed
Jotape daughter of Artavasdes of Media. The Armenians made Artaxes,
son of the late Artavasdes, their king. When Octavian overcame Antony
he did not befriend all the Oriental enemies of the latter, but for
purposes of his own set up a rival to Phraates of Parthia in Tiridates.
Cf. c. 32. And, angered at the Armenians, who had dealt harshly with
certain Romans in that kingdom, he held as hostages the brothers of
king Artaxes, and set Artavasdes of Media over Armenia Minor as a check
upon Artaxes. Cf. Dio, LI, 16; LIV, 9. In 734 Augustus went to the
East to arrange affairs there. A campaign against Artaxes was planned,
but he was assassinated. Cf. Dio, LIV, 9; Tac., <cite>Ann.</cite>, II, 3;
Vell., II, 94, 122; Suet. <cite>Aug.</cite>, 21; Jos., <cite>Ant.</cite>, XV, 4,

in the <cite>Res Gestæ</cite>, takes place. Augustus follows the example of
Pompey, who, in dealing with Armenia in 688 had contented himself with
making the Armenian king accept his royalty as a gift from Rome. Cf.
Cic. <cite>pro Sext.</cite> 27. The affair was conducted by Tiberius, not yet
adopted. Cf. Suet. <cite>Tib.</cite>, 9; Vell., II, 122. Henceforth Armenia
was regarded as part of the empire, though its native sovereigns were
continued. Cf. Vell., II, 94, 122: “Armenia restored to the control

<p class="noindent">When Augustus wrote, Italy was separated from Illyricum by the river
Arsia. Yet Illyricum was not counted by him as a province. It had
colonies at Emona, Iader, Salona, and possibly at Epidaurus and Narona.
Cf. C. I. L., III, pp. 489, 374, 304, 287, 291. Mommsen thinks this
omission was intended by Augustus; that he had been able to satisfy
some of his veterans, to whom Italian farms had been promised, with
lands over the Italian border in Illyricum, and because he could not
call it a province, nor yet a part of Italy, he eludes the difficulty
by omitting the Illyrian colonies.</p>

<p class="noindent">The names of the twenty-eight Italian colonies are somewhat difficult
to establish. Several perplexing questions rise in the attempt. What
of the colonies founded by Antony and Octavian as triumvirs? Were they
Antoniæ Juliæ, or some Juliæ and others Antoniæ? If the former were
true and they dropped the name Antoniæ, the result would be far more
than twenty-eight Julian and Augustan colonies. The second probability
is more likely, and that the colonies Antoniæ simply dropped their name
after Actium.</p>

anxious to regain the lost standards from Parthia, and simply played
off Tiridates against Phraates by setting him over Syria. Dio, in the
passage cited, makes mention of a son of Phraates who was captured by
Tiridates and given up to Augustus. This was possibly the Phraates
here mentioned, though there are difficulties in the way of this
explanation. For Augustus implies the voluntary coming of a reigning
king, not the delivery of an abducted prince. We know that in 731
Tiridates was in Rome asking that Parthia be assigned to him, and that
at the same time Phraates sent an embassy begging the restitution of
his son. Cf. Dio, LIII, 33. Augustus laid the matter before the senate,
and by their advice restored the prince in exchange for the standards,
but did not yield to the plea of Tiridates.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_149" href="#FNanchor_149" class="label">149</a> The comment of Mommsen here seems too severe. He says:
“The writer magnifies his splendors beyond what is exact: for the
Parthians and Medes asked Augustus, not so much to appoint kings for
them, as to restore to them those to whom the kingdom had fallen by
hereditary right.” Such a criticism seems to overlook the force of the
word <em>petitos</em>, as applied to <em>reges</em>: they got the kings
they “asked for.”</p>

<p class="noindent">Phraataces was reigning in 754. Cf. Dio, LV, 10; Vell. II, 101. He was

Vonones, and the date must be much earlier, probably c. 760. A Parthian

<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_151" href="#FNanchor_151" class="label">151</a> This chapter is possibly the most weighty in the whole
inscription, inasmuch as it sets forth the view of his policy which
Augustus wished the world to hold. How far his statements in the
opening and closing sentences represent his own actual notions of his
relations to the sovereign power in Rome is a matter of debate. For a
full discussion Mommsen, <cite>Röm. St.</cite> II, p. 723, ff., may be read,
and Gardthausen, <cite>Aug.</cite> Iᵉʳ Th. IIᵉʳ Bd., pp. 485-540 and IIᵉʳ
Th., pp. 277-299.</p>

<p class="noindent">The question is: Did Augustus in any real sense restore the republic,
or did he conceive of himself as monarch, but find it politic to
suppress all outward marks of royalty? Was his chief concern to
maintain the peace and prosperity of the Roman people, with as little
alteration as possible of the old constitutional forms, or was his
object the building up of power for his own sake? This is confessedly
one of the riddles of history. The best that can be done is to study
his actions, estimating their worth and tendency, and leaving the
motives of the great statesman where he hid them,—locked in his own
bosom.</p>

<p class="noindent">Undoubtedly, all through the <cite>Res Gestæ</cite>, as is pointed out in
the introduction, and as has been noticed from time to time in these
notes, one of his great aims is to represent himself as a conservative,
moving within constitutional limits. Coins of the period emphasize the
view set forth in the opening sentence of this chapter with regard to
the restoration of the republic. Cf. Eckhel, VI, 83: <cite>imp. Cæsar
divi f. cos. VI, libertatis p. R. vindex</cite>; “The imperator, Cæsar,
son of the divine (Cæsar) consul for the sixth time, (726) restorer of
the freedom of the Roman people.” Cf. C. I. L. VI, 1527: “the whole
world pacified, the republic restored.” Also, C. I. L. I, p. 384; the
date referred to is Jan. 13, 727: “The senate decreed that an oaken
crown should be fixed above the door of the imperator, Cæsar Augustus,
because he restored the Roman republic.” Contemporary Roman writers
simply echo the views of Augustus. Cf. Ovid, <cite>Fasti</cite>, I, 589,
for Jan. 13, 727, Velleius, II, 89, says: “When the civil wars were
finished in the twentieth year, (724) and the foreign wars brought to
a close, peace was brought back, power restored to the laws, authority
to the tribunals, majesty to the senate, the <em>imperium</em> of the
magistrates reduced to its old time form, the original and ancient
form of the state restored.” Cf. Livy, <cite>Epit.</cite>, CXXXIV. The
Greek Strabo, also a contemporary, writes, XVII, 3, 25: “The country
committed to him the headship of her sovereignty, and made him lord of
peace and war for life.” Later writers, even the Romans, are equally
free in their judgments. Dio, LII, I, says: “From this time (725)
the affairs of Rome began to be in the control of one man
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοναρχεῖσθαι</span>).” Cf. Suet. <cite>Aug.</cite>, 28; Tac. <cite>Ann.</cite>, III,
28. Dio’s account of the conference in which Agrippa advises a real
abdication by Augustus, and Mæcenas urges a bold assumption of supreme
power (LII, 1-40) is regarded as fictitious.</p>

<p class="noindent">The facts in the case are these: In 711 the Titian law gave the
triumvirs a five years’ lease of power. In 716 this was renewed not
by formal legislation, but “by universal consent.” Cf. App., <em>B.
C.</em> V, 95. This triumviral power Augustus wielded till his sixth
consulship, 726, though there was a pretence of its cessation in 721.
Cf. c. 7, N, 1, and Mommsen, <cite>Röm. St.</cite>, II, 698. In this and the
following years he divested himself gradually of one extraordinary
power after another. He could not at once fall back to the position
of an ordinary magistrate. The armies, the laws, the provinces, the
revenues had all been in his control. These he must gradually restore
Cf. Dio, LII, 13; LIII, 4, 9, 10. In 726 he began his return to older
customs by alternating with Agrippa, his colleague, in the consulship,
in having the fasces borne before him by the lictors for a month. Cf.
Dio, LIII, 1. The restoration of the censorship was part of the same
programme. Dio, LIII, 2, says that by an edict he declared all the
revolutionary and extraordinary acts of the triumviral period should
cease to be effective with the expiration of his sixth consulship
(726). The inscription of Jan. 13, 727, above alluded to, C. I. L. I,
p. 384, marks that date as that on which the business of restoring the
provinces was finally given over to the senate.</p>

<p class="noindent">From this time on the senate divided the control of the provinces
with him. Augustus took the troublesome provinces and the frontier
ones, leaving to the senate the older and more peaceable. Over these
provinces he received a proconsular imperium for ten years, which was
renewed at the expiration of that term. In c. 7 he says that he found
the tribunitial power a sufficient basis for all the measures which
he wished to put through. Now the proconsulship and tribuneship were
both ordinary and constitutional offices. Augustus’ occupancy of each
affords an illustration of the way in which he held ordinary offices in
an extraordinary way. For by the old customs a proconsul must exercise
his <em>imperium</em> in his province, and never at Rome. Augustus could
not be in ten provinces at once, and must be at Rome most of the time.
Hence a violation of the constitution was necessary. The tribuneship,
instituted for the protection of plebeians could be held only by a
plebeian. But Augustus was a patrician. For this reason he did not
take the tribuneship in the ordinary way, nor by the ordinary title,
but designated himself as <em>tribunicia potestate</em>, “of tribunitial
authority.”</p>

<p class="noindent">The title <em>princeps</em>, “prince” is never used by Augustus as an
official designation in laws and inscriptions, but indicates simply his
primacy of rank and is so used throughout the <cite>Res Gestæ</cite>. Cf. cc.
13, 30, 32.</p>

show either the crown or the laurels and many of them have both. With
the crown is generally <em>ob civis servatos</em>, “for preserving the
citizens.” The civic crown being the reward of any soldier who saved
a citizen’s life, Augustus was pre-eminently deemed worthy of it,
because he had saved so many by putting an end to the civil wars, and
by his clemency. Cf. Dio, LIII, 16; Suet. <cite>Claud.</cite> 17; Sen. <cite>De

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
